**MNS** is a lightweight, fast, and driverless web vulnerability scanner for identifying security issues in websites, including WAF detection, SQL Injection, Reflected XSS, and File Inclusion. It uses requests-based crawling to discover forms and links, supports WAF bypass techniques, and generates detailed reports.

## üéØ Purpose of the Tool
MNS is designed for penetration testers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers to assess website security. It identifies:

- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- SQL Injection (including Error-based, Union-based, and Blind Time-based)
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Local & Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)

The tool focuses on static and dynamic form discovery via crawling, payload testing with WAF bypass variants, and report generation for analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- ‚ö° **WAF Detection & Bypass:** Detects common WAFs with basic tests and applies bypass methods such as URL encoding, double encoding, case tampering, and SQL comment injection.  
- üí• **SQL Injection Detection:** Supports error-based, union-based, and blind time-based SQL injection with intelligent payload variants.  
- üíª **XSS Detection:** Tests for Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in forms and parameters.  
- üï∏Ô∏è **Crawling:** Requests and BeautifulSoup-powered crawling to discover forms and links without Selenium.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **File Inclusion Testing:** Checks for local and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.  
- üåê **Proxy Support:** Supports HTTP proxies for anonymity.  
- üíæ **Report Generation:** Outputs detailed JSON, HTML, and CSV reports with graphs for vulnerability counts (requires `pandas` and `matplotlib`).  
- üèóÔ∏è **Extensible & Modular:** Payloads can be extended via `payloads.json`.  
- ‚ö° **Multi-threading:** ThreadPoolExecutor for fast, concurrent vulnerability testing.  
- üñåÔ∏è **CLI & Colored Output:** Interactive command-line interface with `colorama` for enhanced readability.
