## üéØ Purpose of the Tool
MNS is designed for penetration testers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers to comprehensively assess website and network security. It identifies:

- Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and supports bypass techniques
- SSL/TLS certificate issues
- SQL Injection (including Blind Boolean & Time-based)
- Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored, DOM)
- CSRF weaknesses
- IDOR / Insecure Direct Object References
- Command Injection
- Local & Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)

The tool also handles modern web applications with AJAX endpoints, JS-generated DOM elements, and API responses, providing detailed reports for analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- ‚ö° **WAF Detection & Bypass:** Detects common WAFs like Cloudflare, Akamai, ModSecurity, Sucuri, and Fortinet. Includes bypass methods such as URL encoding, case tampering, and SQL comment injection.  
- üîê **SSL Certificate Analysis:** Retrieves SSL certificate details (issuer, validity, serial number, signature algorithm, expiration).  
- üí• **SQL Injection Detection:** Supports error-based, union-based, blind boolean, and blind time-based SQL injection. Intelligent parameter typing improves payload selection.  
- üíª **XSS Detection:** Tests for Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in forms, inputs, and headers.  
- üï∏Ô∏è **AJAX & DOM Crawling:** Selenium-powered crawling to handle JS-generated links, forms, and dynamic content.  
- üõ°Ô∏è **CSRF & IDOR Testing:** Automatic CSRF token verification and IDOR testing via parameter manipulation.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Command Injection & File Inclusion:** Tests for system command injection and local/remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.  
- üåê **Proxy & Anonymity Support:** Supports HTTP/SOCKS proxies, Tor, User-Agent rotation, and rate-limit bypass.  
- üíæ **Report Generation:** Outputs detailed JSON, HTML, and CSV reports with graphs for vulnerability counts.  
- üèóÔ∏è **Extensible & Modular:** Payloads and security tests can easily be extended via `payloads.json`.  
- ‚ö° **Multi-threading:** ThreadPoolExecutor for fast, concurrent vulnerability testing.  
- üñåÔ∏è **CLI & Colored Output:** Interactive command-line interface with `colorama` for enhanced readability.
