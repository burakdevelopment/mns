## üéØ Purpose of the Tool
MNS is developed for penetration testers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers to assess website and network security. It detects:

- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- SSL certificate issues
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

It allows quick detection of security issues and provides clear reports for further analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- ‚ö° **WAF Detection:** Identifies popular WAFs such as Cloudflare, Akamai, Sucuri, ModSecurity, Fortinet, and more by analyzing HTTP headers and response content.
- üîê **SSL Certificate Analysis:** Retrieves SSL certificate details including issuer, validity period, serial number, signature algorithm, and days until expiration.
- üí• **SQL Injection Detection:** Tests URLs with common SQL payloads and reports potential vulnerabilities.
- üíª **XSS Testing:** Checks for reflected XSS vulnerabilities using standard payloads in input parameters.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use prompts with colored outputs using the `colorama` library.
- üíæ **Extensible:** Additional payloads or security tests can be added easily.
